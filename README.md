# ProgrammingLanguages-Ontology

This repository contains three OWL/RDF ontology file developed to support the understanding and semantic comparison of core programming concepts between general Algorithms and Data Structures concepts in comparison to Pascal and Python languages.
Originally, it was developped as thre different files imported to the algorithms ontology.
## Ontologies Included
- **Algorithms.owl**: Concepts from introductory Algorithms and Data Structures courses.
- **PythonSyntax.rdf**: Syntax definitions and structures for Python.
- **PascalSyntax.rdf**: Syntax definitions and structures for Pascal.

### Here we provide a single file exported and merged.

## Purpose
The ontologies are designed to:
- Facilitate knowledge transfer between abstract algorithmic thinking and concrete language syntax.
- Support comparison between Pascal and Python implementations.
- Enable SPARQL querying of language relationships, prerequisites, and examples.

## Usage
You can open and explore the ontologies using [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/).  
SPARQL queries used for validation are included in the `/queries` folder.
